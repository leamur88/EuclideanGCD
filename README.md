# EuclideanGCD
### Made By Jonathan Leibovich

This is a very simple python script that helped me find the Greatest Common Divisor of two 
numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm (with steps!)

## How to Run
Simply run the main script using Python v3+
``` 
python3 ./main.py
```

## Usage
Simply run the program and answer the prompts.
Ex:
```
Please input the first number you want to find the gcd for: 15
Please input the other number you want to find the gcd for: 1678
You would like to find the gcd of 15 and 1678? [y/n] y
Step 0: 1678 = 111(15) + 13
Step 1: 15 = 1(13) + 2
Step 2: 13 = 6(2) + 1
Step 3: 2 = 2(1) + 0
The GCD is: 1!
